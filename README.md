## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Changing CSS Styling based on screen's min-width



### What I learned

I used this challenge as an opportunity to reinforce my learning with Semantic HTML and CSS Grid to center elements. In addition, this challenge allowed me to learn applying different styles based on the user's screen width. As a small example:


```css
/*Mobile Style*/
.card{
  width: 60%;
}

/*Desktop Style*/
@media screen and (min-width: 720px){ 
  .card{
    width: 30%;
  }
}
```
